</p><h2>Assignment 1: Image Processing for Tactile Images</h2>
<p>

<p>
This assignment deals with processing of images so that these can be used
for rendering tactile images as discussed in the class.
This requires implementation of the following operations:

</p><ul>
<li>
half toning using Floyd and Steinberg algorithm 
</li><li> 
color or intensity quantization  
</li><li>
embossing filter
</li><li>
(color/intensity based) segmentation, 
</li><li>
edge detection and linking, 
</li><li>
silhoutte (edge/boundary) enhancement, 
</li><li> 
mapping segmented regions with different patterns 
</li></ul>
<p>
The image may also require some pre-processing operations to enhance the 
image for which you can use image enhancement in spatial domain. For color 
or intensity quantization you are required to implement median cut algorithm [1]. Implement edge detection using
Difference of Gaussian (DoG). 
  
</p><h4> Note: </h4> 
<ul>
<li>Assignment can be done in a group of maximum size of two. The group
should not change later.
</li><li>For reading and writing images and other filter functions you may 
use built-in functions from a library like OpenCV/ImageMagick/MATLAB.
</li></ul>

<h4> Submission <img src="new.gif" border=0> </h4> 
The submission of the assignment can be done by the group (if the
group is of two people, only one should submit and include the statement
about what constitutes the group) through <a href = "https://jaijaivanti.cse.iitd.ernet.in/"> Moodle</a>. Please note that Moodle is accessible
only on campus. Those who stay outside campus will have to come to the 
campus to submit. For this reason, the due date has been extended by one day. When you login in Moodle (with your LDAP credentials) you will find 
CSL783 as your registered course.
